# penguin-classification-KNN
Using machine learning algorithms, specifically the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Leveraged crucial features like bill length, bill depth, and flipper length to train the model, resulting in accurate species classification. This project contributes to wildlife conservation by automating identification processes
